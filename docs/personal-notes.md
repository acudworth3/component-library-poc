> Brief note on AI tools.

- Here and there I turn to chatgpt/gemini over google. None of the notes come from these tools.

- PR and ISSUE tempaltes were generated this way
- I tried to have it help with adding imports to the test file but ended up doing it manually
- It helped with string interpolation syntax for the component props
